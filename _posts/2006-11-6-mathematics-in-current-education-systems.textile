This is funny: Incidentally I read <a href="http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2006/03/math-for-programmers.html">two</a> <a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/2006/11/why_does_engine.html">blog posts</a> about our (they actually mean the U.S. but I think it's the same in Germany) education system and how it sucks regarding math or science subjects in general.

Kathy Sierra mentioned the <a href="http://www.ted.com/tedtalks/tedtalksplayer.cfm?key=ken_robinson&amp;flashEnabled=1">TED talk by Sir Ken Robinson</a>. It's brilliant. You definitely have to check it out!
