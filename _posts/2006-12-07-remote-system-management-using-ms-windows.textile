or: Remote access the painful way

If you are lucky enough to use the RDC protocol it's not that painful. But if you are forced to use something like PC Anywhere via a dialup line and then VNC to another machine. Oh boy, that's just pure pain. I had to do something like this yesterday and I really wished I had a simple SSH connection.

Who came up with this stupid "a server OS needs a GUI, too"-idea in the first place? Being forced to use a GUI on a server is just plain stupid and being forced to use it for Remote Access is even worse. I know there's SSH for Windows and stuff... but it's not in the standard distribution and probably never will be. I don't want to imagine the Vista based Server OS from Microsoft and how the GUI will look then.
