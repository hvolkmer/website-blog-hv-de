<p>I never liked Windows, but in the last years I learned to live with it. But sometimes it reminds me why I will never ever even consider liking it. Check this out:</p>

<p>Some process got wild and I wanted to kill it using the Task Manager - which apparently caused the task manager to go nuts as well. I've seen processes which I couldn't kill in Linux but I never saw "kill" itself go crazy.</p>
