<p>It's there. The <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/">Apple iPhone</a>. I want to have one. That was the first thought after browsing through the product page. This is how mobile phone UIs should look like. The touch screen just looks awesome. I like the multiple touch points.</p>
<p>People who know me already know that I like Apple products. But whatever your thoughts on all past apple products have been: This is a product that you can easily like.</p>
<p>And Microsoft thought their Zune was innovative. Excuse me, I have to go to bed... laughing. ;-)</p>
