This is awesome: "Red Hat's new one page SLA":http://enterpriselinuxlog.blogs.techtarget.com/2007/03/22/red-hats-new-one-page-sla/

[via "SvN":http://www.37signals.com/svn/posts/401-red-hat-if-we-ship-it-we-support-it ]

If only all legal documents could be as short as this one. Unfortenately they are not. Trust me, if seen some in the last months...
