And with  I might mean <a href="http://www.apple.com">Apple</a> or the fruit <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple">apple</a>.

Ok. This entry is totally useless... I just wanted to use the  sign ;-) - Does that "" even look like an Apple on windows machines? Is it a UTF-8 character?

<b>Update</b>:
Apparently it's the unicode character 63743 in the <a href="http://sitening.com/extras/utf-8-character-html-encoding/">UTF-8 private space</a>. And it depends on the font if it really gets displayed as "the Apple apple". Interesting.
