<p>So <a href="http://fedora.redhat.com/">Fedora Core 6</a> and (<a href="http://www.kubuntu.com">K</a>)<a href="http://www.ubuntu.com">Ubuntu</a> 6.10 were almost released at the same time last week. First, I tried to upgrade Fedora which failed because of some  package dependencies yum couldn&#8217;t resolve. I have never done a Fedora Update without any hassle. It&#8217;s quite annoying. I wanted to switch back to a Debian based system anyway so I decided to give Kubuntu a try (I&#8217;m more a <span class="caps">KDE</span> user than a Gnome user, hence the K).</p>
<p>I downloaded the Live-CD image, burned it, booted off it and tried to install&#8230; realizing the main reason why I&#8217;m using Fedora right now: The ability to seamlessly install on a Software <span class="caps">RAID</span> / <span class="caps">LVM</span> setup. Ubuntu doesn&#8217;t support that out of the box. It may be possible with some teawking and stuff&#8230; but I&#8217;m tired of all that. I did enough <span class="caps">RAID</span> / <span class="caps">LVM</span> installations manually back in the day using Debian, Gentoo and whatnot. It was fun, it worked, but I&#8217;m lazy now and I want to have some nice installer do all that for me. Fedora does exactly that (but yum just isn&#8217;t as good as apt). Example (And I don&#8217;t have any fancy external repos configured&#8230; at least not many ;) &#8211; anyway yum should be able to handle that):<br />

And yum is just f-in&#8217; slow compared to apt in terms of resolving dependencies and installation/upgrade of new packages in general. So basically <a href="http://www.thisisbroken.com/">it&#8217;s broken</a>.<br />
So I did what I did when I updated Fedora the last time: I downloaded the <span class="caps">DVD</span> Image, burned it, booted off the <span class="caps">DVD</span> and said &#8220;Upgrade&#8221;. That worked quite well and after another &#8220;yum update&#8221; everything was fine. To bad that a simple &#8220;apt-get update &amp;&amp; apt-get dist-upgrade&#8221; would have done the same thing on a Debian based system without problems&#8230; I&#8217;m quite sure.</p>
<p>So being lazy on one side means having to work more on the other one&#8230; Whatever. I&#8217;m running Fedora Core 6 now and a nice thing I noticed are these anti-aliased fonts. Somehow I didn&#8217;t have anti-aliasing activated&#8230; Now I have and it looks quite nice. The Monospace font in &#8220;Konsole&#8221; is nice to look at, too.</pre></p>
