<p>Sometimes I wander around or take a shower and then it just strikes me. Something becomes absolutely clear in my mind and I begin to understand an idea or something I thought about for a long time.</p>
<p>It happened again this morning when I was walking from the bus stop to the office. I thought about which new programming language I want to learn next year (Part of Tip 8 of &#8220;The Pragmatic Programmer&#8221; book) and about learning in general. I think I found the value of learning for myself. </p>
<p>I want to learn a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming_language">functional programming language</a> next year, because I haven&#8217;t learned one yet and some aspects of functional programming find their way into &#8220;everyday programming languages&#8221; (not meaning that there aren&#8217;t functional programming languages which can&#8217;t be used for &#8220;everyday tasks&#8221;). Closures, for example. I love blocks in Ruby! Unfortunately closures will find their way into Java in Java 7 at the earliest. There isn&#8217;t even a <span class="caps">JSR</span> yet. It&#8217;s on the <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/ahe/entry/java_se_7_wish_list">wish list</a> . But I&#8217;m loosing track.</p>
<p>So I looked at <a title="Haskell" href="http://www.haskell.org">Haskell</a> which is a purely functional language. Then I found out that it has syntactically relevant white space, which is&#8230; let&#8217;s say something you have to get used to (and I never really liked in <a href="http://www.python.org">Python</a> ). Another point which I found why not to choose Haskell was: There are no &#8220;real&#8221; applications out there written in Haskell. There are of course a lot of applications written in Haskell but they seem to be some fun or research projects and no &#8220;End user&#8221; application among them.</p>
<p>So why learn something which I wouldn&#8217;t be able to use &#8220;in real life&#8221;. Alternatives I have considered are <a title="The Caml Language" href="http://caml.inria.fr/">OCaml</a> which is used in some &#8220;real&#8221; applications put it&#8217;s not a purely functional language and <a href="http://erlang.org/">Erlang</a> which seems to be focused on concurrency and actually was created in a &#8220;real life&#8221; environment. There&#8217;s even a Web framework for Erlang available now: <a href="http://erlyweb.org/">ErlyWeb</a> .</p>
<p>Then I thought: OK. So I want to learn something about functional programming. Haskell is a purely functional Language so why should I care whether I can use the language for anything useful at all? The answer is: I shouldn&#8217;t care! The learning process itself is the value I get out of it (and of course the functional way of thinking of programs)! And that&#8217;s the main goal of this whole &#8220;learning a new language&#8221; experience, isn&#8217;t it?</p>
<p>That could be the whole point about learning in general. Of course it matters what I learn (if I want to use the knowledge or skills I learned). But if I learned nothing useful at all, I still learned something about learning. That may sound a bit self referential but I think that&#8217;s what excites me about learning new things. That&#8217;s a good motivation for learning. The process of learning something new is so interesting that it doesn&#8217;t really matter what I learn.</p>
