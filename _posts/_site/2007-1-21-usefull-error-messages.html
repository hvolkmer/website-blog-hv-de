<p>&#8230; are great. Here&#8217;s one I came across while trying to recover data from a hard disk image of a broken hard disk:</p>
<pre>
core backup # xfs_repair -f data.image
Phase 1 - find and verify superblock...
superblock read failed, offset 249108103168, size 2048, ag 0, rval 58

fatal error -- Success
core backup #
</pre>
<p>fatal error &#8212; Success. Now that&#8217;s a useful message, isn&#8217;t it? Btw. the image wasn&#8217;t recoverable&#8230;</p>
