<p>I just listened to the <a href="http://se-radio.net/index.php?post_id=116460">SE-Radio Episode 26</a>, where <a href="http://www.jeckstein.de/">Jutta Eckstein</a> mentioned the <a href="http://www.waterfall2006.com">Waterfall 2006</a> conference. If you have a look at the website and know only one or two of the names on the list and recognize the date of conference, you just know what this &#8220;conference&#8221; thing is about. If you want to have a laugh just read through the descriptions of the talks.</p>
<p>The most surprising thing however was, that there apparently where people who thought this was a real thing and said things like &#8220;I always thought that people like Kent Beck would finally understand what is important&#8221;. (Check out the podcast at about 25:00)</p>
<p>If you click on the registration link you get this message:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We&#8217;re sorry but registration is not yet ready. Our software developers have a really wonderful design. They&#8217;re almost done entering it into it a <span class="caps">UML</span> tool. They&#8217;ve told us not to worry and that finishing it will be &#8220;trivial&#8221; because &#8220;all that&#8217;s left is the coding.&#8221;</p>
<p>We&#8217;re not sure what features will be on the registration pages because the developers haven&#8217;t talked to us about what we&#8217;d like but we&#8217;re sure it will be wonderful. Meanwhile, you may want to plan on just showing up at the conference with a credit card and if there&#8217;s space available, we&#8217;ll let you in.</p>

<p>All that happened about a year ago and I discovered it just now, but I think it&#8217;s still funny, though.</p>
