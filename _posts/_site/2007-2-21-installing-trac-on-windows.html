<p>This is not a tutorial. There is a <a href="http://trac.edgewall.org/wiki/TracOnWindows">good one</a> on the TracWiki. I just want to tell everyone, that if you ever consider installing Trac on Windows, then just don&#8217;t do it and install it on a *nix machine. This will save you a lot of time and nerves. There are even <a href="http://buildix.thoughtworks.com/">pre-build environments</a> available with <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org"><span class="caps">SVN</span></a>, <a href="http://trac.edgewall.com">Trac</a> and <a href="http://cruisecontrol.sf.net">Cruisecontrol</a>.</p>
<p>I spent almost an entire day to configure Trac on Windows. It&#8217;s not funny. If you have to do it, be sure to use the <a href="http://trac.edgewall.org/wiki/TracModPython">mod_python setup</a>. It&#8217;s far easier to install than trying to set up <span class="caps">CGI</span> on a Windows box (which I think would be the first and easiest setup on *nix machines). I may not be the smartest person on earth but the Apache error messages on Windows are just plain useless. I don&#8217;t care if it&#8217;s Apache&#8217;s fault, Windows&#8217; fault or my own. It&#8217;s <a href="http://www.thisisbroken.com/">just broken</a>.</p>
<p>So if you have no other choice than using Windows, make sure that you use a plain Apache from <a href="http://httpd.apache.org">apache.org</a> &#8211; No <a href="http://www.apachefriends.org/">xampp</a>, <a href="http://typo3.org/download/installers/">Typo 3 package</a> or anything like that. Some of these packages come with their own version of Python which really fucks things up, if it&#8217;s not the version you need). This will save you a lot of trouble.</p>
<p>The main problem we had here was the &#8220;We already have an Apache on this server, so why not install on this one?&#8221;-thing. The Apache installation turned out to be one of the packages mentioned above which made things not really easier.</p>
