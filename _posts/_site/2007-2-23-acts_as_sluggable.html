<p>There are some <a href="http://www.jroller.com/page/obie/20070203">Blog posts</a> out there about Rails and nice URLs for <span class="caps">SEO</span>. I don&#8217;t know if it really works, but it&#8217;s easy to do and nice URLs can never be wrong, can they?</p>
<p>There&#8217;s also a plugin called <a href="http://dev.2750flesk.com/acts_as_sluggable/">acts_as_sluggable</a> which does exactly that, so that you can do things like</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
<code>
class BlogPost
  acts_as_sluggable :with =&gt; :title
end
</code>
</pre>
<p>And get <span class="caps">URIS</span> like</p>
<p><code>
http://www.example.com/blogposts/3-my-cat-ate-my-flowers
</code></p>
<p>There are some problems with act_as_slugable and Rails 1.2, though. Acts_as_sluggable comes with some ActiveRecord monkey patching for the find_from_ids method. As mentioned by Obie Fernandez this isn&#8217;t necessary for Rails 1.2 because Rails all the to_i-stuff itself. So if you want to use the plugin with Rails 1.2 just comment out the active_records_overrides.rb contents and you should be fine.</p>
