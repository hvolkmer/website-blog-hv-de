<p>I remember sitting here almost exactly one year ago, without a Mac and without a job where I can do Rails development full time. I&#8217;m lucky that I can say: the dark days of Java development are over :). Wow, it&#8217;s really been one year since the last Rails Conf Europe. Time progresses fast. I&#8217;m really excited to hear interesting speakers and talk to people who also do Rails stuff or are interested in doing it. You can get a vast amount of conference material (videos, slides) on the internet these days, but you cannot get the &#8220;conference feeling&#8221;, the conversations with other people and all that stuff. And that&#8217;s what I like the most about these conferences. Especially with the Ruby and Rails communities, where the people seem to be particularly nice and friendly.</p>
<p>Last year I deceided to arrive in the morning. It was stressfull. I had to get up really early and almost didn&#8217;t make it in time for the opening keynote. And I wasn&#8217;t able to attend the Rails-Pizza-Event thing. So this year I will arrive a day before the conference which opens the opportunity to attend the Bratwurst-on-Rails event this evening.</p>
<p>German Airports suck btw. At least this tiny one in Stuttgart. Although there&#8217;s a <span class="caps">WLAN</span> you have to pay for it. When will free Wifi be available everywhere or at least at airports?</p>
