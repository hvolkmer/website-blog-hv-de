<p>It&#8217;s not that easy to get up at 7 o&#8217;clock. It&#8217;s even harder if you realize that you could have slept almost an hour more&#8230; Someone told us yesterday that the keynote speech would start at 8:15 so we managed to get here at 8 just to realize that the keynote will start at 9. At least we&#8217;ll get good seats then.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll try to get some coffee now&#8230; I really need it.</p>
