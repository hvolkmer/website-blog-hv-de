<p>Talking to interesting, intelligent people form all over the world has been a great experience. One thing which stuck in my mind was one guy from the UK (I am so bald with names&#8230;) who referred to himself as a &#8220;agile convert&#8221;. Having been in the software business for about 20 years he couldn&#8217;t believe that &#8220;this agile thing would work&#8221;. And now he doesn&#8217;t want to do anything else :)</p>
