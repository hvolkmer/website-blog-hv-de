<p>RailsConf Europe 2007 is over and it&#8217;s time to wrap up.  So&#8230; I don&#8217;t want reproduce the content of all the presentations I&#8217;ve attended because several other people already did. I&#8217;ll just link to their posts. Instead I want to to give a subjective view of all the talks I&#8217;ve seen.  I have no idea if that&#8217;s of any value to anybody else but maybe it is. No pictures this year&#8230; I was to lazy to bring my <span class="caps">DSLR</span> camera and forgot to borrow a smaller point and shoot cam&#8230; There are a lot of pictures of the event on <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/railsconfeurope07/">flickr</a></p>
