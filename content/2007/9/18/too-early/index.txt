It's not that easy to get up at 7 o'clock. It's even harder if you realize that you could have slept almost an hour more... Someone told us yesterday that the keynote speech would start at 8:15 so we managed to get here at 8 just to realize that the keynote will start at 9. At least we'll get good seats then.

I'll try to get some coffee now... I really need it.
