*Bratwurst on rails*

Railsconf started with the "Bratwurst on rails":http://www.bratwurst-on-rails.com/ event organized by the "Berlin Ruby User Group":http://www.rug-b.com/wiki/show/HomePage. Free Bratwurst for everyone :)

Talking to interesting, intelligent people form all over the world has been a great experience. One thing which stuck in my mind was one guy from the UK (I am so bald with names...) who referred to himself as a "agile convert". Having been in the software business for about 20 years he couldn't believe that "this agile thing would work". And now he doesn't want to do anything else :)
