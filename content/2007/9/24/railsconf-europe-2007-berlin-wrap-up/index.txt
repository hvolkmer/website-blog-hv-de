RailsConf Europe 2007 is over and it's time to wrap up.  So... I don't want reproduce the content of all the presentations I've attended because several other people already did. I'll just link to their posts. Instead I want to to give a subjective view of all the talks I've seen.  I have no idea if that's of any value to anybody else but maybe it is. No pictures this year... I was to lazy to bring my DSLR camera and forgot to borrow a smaller point and shoot cam... There are a lot of pictures of the event on "flickr":http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/railsconfeurope07/
