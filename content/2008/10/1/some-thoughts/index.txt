... not my own... well actually most of them are.

<blockquote>
* helping other people helps me
* having guts always works out for me
* thinking life will be better in the future is stupid. i have to live now
* starting a charity is surprisingly easy
* being not truthful works against me
* everyting i do always comes back to me
* assuming is stifling
* drugs feel great in the beginning and become a drag later on
* over time i get used to everything and start taking for granted
* money does not make me happy
* travelling alone is helpful for a new perspective on life
* keeping a diary supports personal development
* trying to look good limits my life
* material luxuries are best enjoyed in small doses
* worrying solves nothing
* complaining is silly. either act or forget
* actually doing the things I set out to do increases my overall level of satisfaction
* everybody thinks they are right
* low expectations are a good strategy
* whatever I want to explore professionally, its best to try it out for myself first
* everybody who is honest is interesting
