I just encountered "this problem":http://kb.adobe.com/selfservice/viewContent.do?externalId=kb400587&sliceId=2 and I can totally understand this blog post: "If Adobe were a man, i would punch him":http://www.wemakepretty.com/2007/04/24/if-adobe-were-a-man-i-would-punch-him/

Let me remind you: This is a product that costs about 1K EUR and it's the year 2008.

So "Dear Adobe":http://dearadobe.com/ : Please fix your products!
