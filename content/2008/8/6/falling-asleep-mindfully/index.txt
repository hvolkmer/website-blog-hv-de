When I was going to sleep yesterday I realized that I pictured my thoughts and wondered if I can consciously realize the moment I fall asleep. There weren't many thoughts. It was like a big black void and some "thoughts" where flying around. Then they started to disappear, fading out or just going away. Then I thought: "I'm.... going... to fall asleep.... now". Then I was asleep. I think it's the second time that had this experience. It's quite intersting.

Did this ever happen to you?
