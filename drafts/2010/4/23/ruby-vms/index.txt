1.8.7 fuckup (I call it "crack release" because someone must have smoked crack and then backported some features from 1.9 to 1.8)

Strange behaviour (or let's say error messages): http://www.stephensykes.com/blog_perm.html?152

Patchlevels braking strange stuff (e.g. Marshal format) http://redmine.ruby-lang.org/issues/show/2597#note-3 - this is "patchlevel" - not even minor release.

Fixed on 04/20/2010 - no new release... since then.

=> Back to ruby-1.8.7-p174

we're talking about "running" not even "writing".
